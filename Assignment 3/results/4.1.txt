The unwindowed Sine and Square plots are the same as the rectangular-windowed ones.
The Hann-windowed magnitude plots were the same as the originals, while the phase flipped signs for 
the sine plot and reflected over the x-axis to create both positive and negative values at the same 
indices on the square wave Hann plot.
